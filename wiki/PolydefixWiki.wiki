== Introduction ==

Multifit/Polydefix is a software package originally written to process data obtained in the D-DIA deformation apparatus efficiently. It allows you to decompose 2D diffraction images into azimuthal slices, fit peak positions and intensities, and propagate the results of your fit to other azimuth and images.

Multifit can fit diffraction data. It will extract d-spacings, intensities, and half-widths for the peaks you're interrested in, for multiple orientations and multiple diffraction images.

Polydefix is for stress and strain analysis. It will start from the output files created in Multifit and extract microscopic strain information from the diffraction images.

Since June 2011, it is free software, licensed under the [GPLVersion2 GPL Version 2].
