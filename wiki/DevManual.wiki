= Multifit/Polydefix Basic Developer Manual =

== Introduction ==

Both Multifit and Polydefix are developed using the IDL programming language from the [http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx Exelis]. The main source code is located here, at Google Code and available to every one. 

It is distributed as a package for the [http://www.exelisvis.com/Support/HelpArticlesDetail/TabId/219/ArtMID/900/ArticleID/12395/The-IDL-Virtual-Machine.aspx IDL virtual machine], which can be downloaded for free. There was a change of policy recently and the virtual machine is not so easy to find. Basically, try to create an account and download a trial version of IDL. The trial version of IDL does include the virtual machine. Here is a link with instructions for [http://www.exelisvis.com/Support/HelpArticlesDetail/TabId/219/ArtMID/900/ArticleID/4633/4633.aspx starting a virtual machine application].

In order to develop and improve Multifit and Polydefix, however, you will need to purchase a license for IDL.

IDL comes with a complex eclipse-based development environment in a graphical user interface (gui) for editing projects. Over the years the gui became more and more complex. It is a complete overkill for what we are doing here. Moreover, each upgrade of IDL comes with technical issues and, recently, it simply stopped working on my computers. Therefore, I decided to _completely quit using the IDL gui_ for developing applications and develop multifit/polydefix in text mode only. You are welcome to try using the gui if you want, but I will not help you with it.

The instructions below assume you are running linux. If you are on a mac or on windows, instructions should be quite similar. Drop me an email if you have precise instructions I can include here.

== Getting the code ==

The main codes are located in
 * Multifit: https://multifit-polydefix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Multifit
 * Polydefix: https://multifit-polydefix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Polydefix
 * PolydefixED: https://multifit-polydefix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/PolydefixED

You should first create a folder for storing a local copy
{{{
mkdir ~/IDL
}}}

Then, you should download the latest version of the code. For multifit, for instance
{{{
cd ~/IDL
svn checkout https://multifit-polydefix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Multifit
}}}
This will create a `Multifit` folder within the folder you created.

== Compiling, editing, and playing with the code ==

Now that you downloaded the latest version of the code, you can simply open the files in your favorite text editor. We, here in Lille, use `kate`, one of the KDE text editor. It does have a specific mode for coloring IDL codes (select `Tools -> Highlighting -> Sources -> RSI IDL`).

To compile and run the code, you should move into the folder with your source, start IDL in the command line, and type `@build`:
{{{
cd ~/IDL/Multifit
idl
@build
}}}
You can then test your changes by typing
{{{
multifit
}}} 
in the command line. It will start the latest version you compiled.

Once you're done, if you want to quit IDL, simply type `exit` in the IDL command line.

I do not recommend the IDL development environment. On the other hand, the online help is extremely helpful. To start the help from the command line, simply type `idlhelp`.

== Exchanging information with the Google servers ==

To download a more recent version of the code from the Google server, open a unix terminal (do not start IDL), move into the folder with the code, and update its content using subversion:
{{{
cd ~/IDL/Multifit
svn update
}}}

Tu upload your changes to the Google servers, open a unix terminal (do not start IDL), move into the folder with the code, and upload your changes using subversion:
{{{
cd ~/IDL/Multifit
svn commit --username YOUR_USER_NAME   --password YOUR_PASSWORD -m "Tell us what you did"
}}}
The `Tell us what you did` section is extremely important. Write a simple text explaining what you did with the code. It is recorded with your upload so other users can understand what you were trying to do.

Last advise: upload your changes often to avoid conflicts with other developers.

== Old instructions ==

I did keep a copy of our [OldDevManual old developer instructions] as reference. Please, do not follow them.

== Creating a new branch ==

Once we feel we are ready for a new version, I will create a new "Branch" with the command 
{{{
svn copy https://multifit-polydefix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Multifit https://multifit-polydefix.googlecode.com/svn/branches/Multifit-X.X -m "Creating version XXX"
}}}
