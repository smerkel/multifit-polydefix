#summary Basic developer manual

= Introduction =

Both Multifit and Polydefix are developed using the IDL programming language from the [http://www.ittvis.com/ ITT Visual Information Solutions]. The main source code is located here, at Google Code and available to every one. 

It is distributed as a package for the IDL virtual machine, which can be downloaded for free from the [http://www.ittvis.com/ ITT website].

In order to develop and improve Multifit and Polydefix, however, you will need to purchase a license for IDL.

= Getting the code =

The main codes are located in
 * Multifit: https://multifit-polydefix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Multifit
 * Polydefix: https://multifit-polydefix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Polydefix
 * PolydefixED: https://multifit-polydefix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/PolydefixED

You can get the codes from within IDL. In IDL
 * Select the menu item _Window -> Source Control -> Subversion_. It may ask you to install some extension. To be honest, I can't remember which one I chose.
 * You will see a tab _SVN Repositories_, click on the _New repository location_ icon.
 * Enter the URL, listed above, and give it a label if you wish,
 * Username and password are not necessary to get the code, but will be required if you want to upload your code back.
 * IDL will then copy the current version of Multifit into your working directory. It will show up as a project somewhere in the interface.
